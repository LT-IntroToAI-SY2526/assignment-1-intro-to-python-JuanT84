# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_practice_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## What You Need to Submit
1. **Complete the `a1_practice_problems.py` in class**.  Mr. Berg will push solutions to github
2. **Complete the `a1.py` file** with your AI-generated problems and solutions
3. **Complete the reflection questions** in `a1_writeup.md`
4. **Push your changes to GitHub**

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

After completing your problems, reflect on:

1. **What was your initial experience with Python?** How did it compare to other programming languages you've used?

    My initial experience with Python was relatively ok. It is much simpler then Java which I have some experience with. It has much more freedom but is a little more complicated to indent.I would compare it to Java by saying it is easier to create code. It has more built in functions and makes it easier. I do howwver prefer javas indentation I liked the bracket because it makes it easier to indent.

2. **How did you use AI effectively?** Give specific examples of good prompts you used and what you learned from the responses.

    Some specific prompts I used are "Check my code" "How to ...(ex. use for loop), "Why and how does...(ex. f")work?. I learned how to use different functions and how to specifically look for certain requests instead of asking for the answer. This allows me to learn instead of rely on AI and makes it so I can work at my own pace by checking with AI and continuing.

3. **What concepts were most challenging?** How did AI help you understand them?

    Some of the more challenging concepts were the median and duck duck goose. Navigatin the new structure and different functions was somewhat challenging but by asking AI how to specifically use them and why they work it allowed me to continue to make future problems easier to solve. AI helped explain why and in what scenarios it is used.

4. **What did you learn about collaborating with AI?** What strategies worked best for learning rather than just getting answers?

    I learned that AI can be a very useful tool instead of an answer all. It is better as a tool because it allows me to learn. Some strategies that wprked best for learning were asking for specific functions and how to use them. This helps because it helps explain when to use it. In asking it to check my work it also allows for me to learn from m mistakes and correct them while asking for further explanation if needed.
