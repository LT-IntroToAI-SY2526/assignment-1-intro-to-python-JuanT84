MY ORIGINAL AI PROMPT:
[Paste the prompt you used to generate your problem set here]

"I'm learning Python basics in a high school programming class. I'm new to programming. Can you create 5-7 practice problems that cover:
> - Variables and basic data types
> - Conditionals (if/elif/else)
> - Loops (for and while)
> - Functions
> - Basic list operations
> 
> Make them progressively more challenging. Make sure each problem has clear instructions and example inputs/outputs."

Example: "I'm learning Python basics in a high school programming class. 
I have some experience with Java. Can you create 5-7 practice problems that cover..."

PROBLEM 1: [Problem Title/Description]
[Copy the complete problem description from your AI assistant]

Example:
Problem: Write a function called 'is_even' that takes an integer and returns 
True if the number is even, False if it's odd.

Example inputs/outputs:
- is_even(4) should return True
- is_even(7) should return False

"""Problem 1: Hello, Variables!/Concepts: Variables, Strings, Integers/Instructions:
Create a program that asks the user for their name and age, then prints a greeting with their name and how old theyâ€™ll be next year.

Example:
Input:
  What is your name? Alice
  How old are you? 15

Output:
  Hello, Alice! Next year, you will be 16 years old.
